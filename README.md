# Road-Accident-Tableau-Project-
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident datasets to gain deep insights into accident patterns and underlying causes.
Using Tableau, a series of interactive dashboards have been designed to explore accident distributions based on factors like time, location, vehicle type, and environmental conditions.

The primary goal is to assist policymakers and stakeholders by presenting actionable insights for improving road safety and reducing accident rates.
